# ⚡Global Hack Week (AI-ML) Challenge Submission

Welcome to the repository for my submissions to the Global Hack Week AI-ML challenges organized by MLH (Major League Hacking). Throughout the week, I participated in various workshops, learned basic to advanced AI-ML techniques, and worked on several projects. Below is a summary of the challenges I completed along with brief descriptions of the projects I created. 🚀

## Challenges Completed:

1. ✅ **Build Your First AI game**
2. ✅ **Process Dataset**
3. ✅ **Implement Data Structures**
4. ✅ **Use Speech to Text or Text to Speech**
5. ✅ **Try Using NLP**
6. ✅ **Leverage Sentiment Analysis**
7. ✅ **Hack with ChatGPT**
8. ✅ **Detect Spam**
9. ✅ **Movie Recommender**
10. ✅ **Object Detection**

## Project Details:

- 🎮 **Tetris AI**: A Python-based Tetris game with an AI component that autonomously plays the game using various algorithms.
  
- 📊 **Dataset Processing**: Utilized Google's data processing techniques to clean, preprocess, and analyze datasets efficiently. 

- 📋 **Data Structures Demo**: Python scripts demonstrating the implementation and usage of various data structures. 

- 🗣️ **Speech to Text Web App**: A web application capable of transcribing audio/video inputs to text using speech-to-text. 

- 📈 **Sentiment Analysis Dashboard**: A dashboard visualizing sentiment analysis results on mobile sales data.

- 📄 **PDF Chat Application**: An application allowing users to conversational interactions with PDF files using the OpenAI API. 

- 🛑 **Spam/Ham Detector**: A web application that detects spam/ham emails using Multinomial Naive Bayes. 

- 🎥 **Movie Recommender Engine**: Utilized Content based filtering techniques to build a movie recommender system. 

- 📸 **Custom Object Detection**: a custom object detection model using yolov5 to identify underwater plastic trash in images. 

## How to Run:

Each project is contained within its respective folder in this repository. Detailed instructions on how to set up and run each project can be found in their respective README files. 🛠️
